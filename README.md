# Javasnake
Build a simple snake game with HTML, JavaScript, CSS and jQuery.

## Learning Objectives
1. Master HTML tables, rows and cells.
1. Practice using several useful jQuery methods, including: `addClass, removeClass, hasClass, closest, children, index, append, on`, and `eq`.
1. Learn about using `window.setInterval()` to handle timed or reoccurring events.
1. Really embrace the idea of methods as modules. Write each of your functions its own .js file, and require them in as needed.
1. Make the game your own! Go wild with the CSS, or add in a unique new feature.

## Plan
1. Make a sequential list of steps for yourself before you begin.
